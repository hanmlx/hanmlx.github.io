                        <p>This project involved a study on the effectiveness of a specific treatment technique for cancer, using data provided by an American hospital. We learned to organize our work using a schedule, which was essential to meet deadlines.</p>
                        <p>From March to June, my team and I conducted an exciting project aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a specific treatment technique for cancer.</p>
                        <h3>Main Objective</h3>
                        <p>Our goal was to determine whether a given treatment technique was effective for cancer patients.</p>
                        <h3>Methodology and Tools</h3>
                        <p>To carry out this project, we used the <strong>R programming language</strong> for data cleaning and analysis.</p>
                        <h4>Key Steps</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Organization and Planning</strong>: We set up a detailed schedule to manage our tasks and meet deadlines.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Cleaning</strong>: We identified and corrected errors and anomalies to ensure reliable data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong>: We applied statistical methods to evaluate correlations between the treatment technique and patient outcomes.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                        <p><strong>Remote Work</strong> 
                            Synchronizing files caused problems, making collaboration more complex.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> 
                            Graphical analysis, especially heatmaps, initially presented challenges.
                            With the help of our professor, we overcame these obstacles and deepened our understanding.
                        </p>
    
                        <h3>Skills Developed</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>R Programming</li>
                            <li>Statistics</li>
                            <li>Collaboration and Organization</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Results and Conclusions</h3>
                        <p>The results showed that the technique reduced mortality by 14% in patients who had suffered a heart attack, indicating its effectiveness for this group. However, for patients with vascular problems or who had had a heart attack, the treatment seemed to increase mortality. Overall, although patients treated with this technique had less favorable initial prognoses, the treatment showed no significant differences in variables like blood pressure and heart rate. These results highlight the importance of carefully selecting patients for this procedure.</p>

                        <p>This project involved the design and implementation of a database for the LB AXA BOS banking group, following their merger. We learned to organize our work using a schedule, which was essential to meet deadlines.</p>
                        <p>From April to June, our team carried out an exciting project aimed at structuring the data, importing it, validating it, and addressing the issue of forecasting staffing needs.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Main Objective</h3>
                        <p>Our goal was to structure the data, import it, validate it, and address the issue of forecasting staffing needs. The project aimed to increase productivity by 3% in the workforce.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Methodology and Tools</h3>
                        <p>For this project, we used the following tools:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Microsoft Access</strong> for designing and managing the database.</li>
                                <li><strong>Excel</strong> for preparing and transforming data.</li>
                                <li><strong>SQL</strong> for queries and data analysis.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>Key Steps</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Organization and Planning</strong>: We set up a detailed schedule to manage our tasks and meet deadlines.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analysis of Raw Files</strong>: We analyzed raw files to identify unnecessary columns and data to transform.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Transformation</strong>: We transformed data formats for easier import (e.g., converting text formats to numbers).</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Loading</strong>: We imported the data into Access and checked for potential errors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Identification and Correction of Anomalies</strong>: We identified and corrected several anomalies, such as closed establishments with ongoing operations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Results Analysis</strong>: We calculated productivity rates and forecasts for staffing to achieve a 3% increase.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                        <p><strong>Remote Work</strong>: Synchronizing files caused problems, making collaboration more complex. We used online collaboration tools to share files and updates in real time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong>: Analyzing the data, especially complex queries, initially posed challenges. Thanks to our professor's guidance and documentation, we overcame these obstacles and deepened our understanding.</p>

                        <h3>Results and Conclusions</h3>
                        <p>The results show that the goal of a 3% increase in productivity was not achieved in nearly all cases. We proposed specific adjustments for each product category and commercial division. Our recommendations include:
